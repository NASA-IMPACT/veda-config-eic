description: "
  The Earth Pulse displays live communication with a selection of the NASA/NOAA/USGS fleet of satellites that study the Earth.
  Activity in the lights means data is being transmitted, with the amount of light indicating the amount of data being transferred.
  The name of the specific mission communicating the data is indicated in lights on the sculpture.
  Watch the data streams and imagine what they reveal about our Earth.
