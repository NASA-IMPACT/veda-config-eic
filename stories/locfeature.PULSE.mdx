description: "
  The Earth Pulse displays live communication with a selection of NASA's fleet of satellites that study the Earth.
  More activity in the lights means more data is being transmitted. Lights moving upward reflect communication transmitted from ground stations directly up to a satellite.
  Downlinks from the satellites back to Earth flow downward.
  The name of the specific mission activity communicating the data is indicated in lights on the sculpture.
  Watch the data streams and imagine what they reveal about our changing planet.
