    ## Info
    Producing food has always been challenging, and in the 21st century, human-caused climate change is already affecting food security through increasing temperatures, increased frequency of extreme events, and changing precipitation patterns.

    Earth data has increasingly become part of the food farming process.
    Observations from satellites, aircraft, ground sensors, and surveys, combined with high-end computer modeling are used by scientists working with Federal agencies who collaborate with farmers, ranchers, fishermen, and decision-makers to share their understanding of the relationship between the Earth system and the environments that provide food across the globe.
