        "caption":"NASA partners with the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) to help stabilize world food markets by providing critical Earth observation data that tracks global crop production. Each month, this data feeds into the World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates (WASDE) report—an essential resource used by farmers, traders, and policymakers to forecast agricultural trends and anticipate global food supply disruptions.  Using satellite observations combined with ground reports and meteorological data, NASA enables USDA analysts to monitor crops across the planet—including regions that are otherwise hard to access. This global perspective helps identify emerging droughts, floods, and other agricultural risks before harvest, allowing markets to respond quickly and effectively.  By delivering timely, science-based insights from space, NASA supports smarter farming decisions and helps keep food prices more stable for consumers around the world. Credit: NASA/USDA "
