  Wildfires near homes can be deadly when they are out of control, but wildfires are also key to keeping ecosystems healthy and thriving.
  Learn about how wildfires have intensified with a changing climate across the world and how Earth data are being used to identify, track and monitor wildfires and their associated risks.

    ## Info

    Changes in climate, weather, vegetation and the landscape all play a role in whether a spark becomes a flame.
    Wildfires, also referred to as wildland fires, pose threats to human safety across large geographic regions and can cause widespread health and ecological impacts.
    For instance, smoke from fires can impact air quality in areas across the country or even the world.
    At the same time, wildfires are a natural process that maintains ecosystem stability reinforcing the need to understand the multifaceted nature of fires across the landscape.
    The unique vantage point offered by Earth observing satellites provides researchers and land managers with the ability to assess broadscale extents of fire related hazards that is not possible with traditional ground-based monitoring.
    This information is used by agencies at multiple levels of government and management teams on the ground during all stages of wildfires, including monitoring fire prone regions, tracking and responding to active wildfires and assessing post wildfire zones.

      Wildland fires, which are natural and essential for many ecosystems, have increased in frequency and size due to longer fire seasons, climate change, and the expanding interface between communities and wild vegetation. Using fire strategically—through prescribed burns and natural ignitions—can mitigate future severe fires that might burn more intensely under hotter, drier conditions. Data-driven decisions and community collaboration guide proactive fire management. With the help of satellite observations, the USDA, Forest Service, Rocky Mountain Research Station and NASA research advance proactive strategies for healthier forests, reducing future fire risks.
