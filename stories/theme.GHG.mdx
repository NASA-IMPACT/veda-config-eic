  Greenhouse gases (GHGs) in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and slow heat loss into space.
  Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, from burning fossil fuels, has caused cascading changes to many of Earth's vital life-supporting systems.
  Learn how federal data are being used to shed light on the sources and hotspots of GHG emissions and to understand the associated impacts on the climate.

    ## Info

    Greenhouse gases (GHGs) refers to a suite of gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, found in Earth's atmosphere that naturally trap heat and maintain Earth's global temperature.
    However, human activities over the last century led to unprecedented amounts of GHGs being released into the atmosphere resulting in warming the planet at an alarming rate.

    Earth's climate is changing at a pace that threatens human health, society and the natural environment.
    These changes include warmer air and ocean temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, retreating snow and ice, increasingly severe weather events, such as hurricanes of greater intensity and sea level rise, among other impacts.
    Federal agencies are working together to develop a Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Information System (GHGMIS) for the U.S. to improve measurement of GHG emissions and sinks and track progress towards meet climate mitigation goals.
    This system uses these advanced capabilities, including the expanded use of GHG observational data and models, to provide enhanced GHG emissions and uptake data estimates that can be used by decision-makers.

            The NOAA Annual Greenhouse Gas Index from 1979 to 2021, illustrating the cumulative contributions of different greenhouse gases to global warming. The stacked bar chart shows the increase in greenhouse gas concentrations over time, with each bar representing a year and the different colors indicating the contributions of specific gases: carbon dioxide (CO₂) in red, methane (CH₄) in purple, nitrous oxide (N₂O) in blue, and other gases in yellow. The accompanying donut chart on the right highlights the relative contributions of these gases to global warming, emphasizing the dominant role of CO₂, followed by CH₄, N₂O, and other gases.
