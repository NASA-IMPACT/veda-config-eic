  Greenhouse gases in the Earth's atmosphere trap heat and slow heat loss into space.
  Increases in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, from burning fossil fuels, has caused cascading changes to many of Earth's vital life-supporting systems.
  Learn how federal data is being used to shed light on the sources and hotspots of GHG emissions and to understand the associated impacts on the climate.

    The sky transitions from a deep blue to warm orange tones, and a layer of clouds is bathed in golden light, creating a striking contrast between the darkened earth below and the bright sky above.

    ## Info

    Greenhouse gases (GHGs) refers to a suite of gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, found in Earth's atmosphere that naturally trap heat and maintain Earth's global temperature.
    However, human activities over the last century led to unprecedented amounts of GHGs released into the atmosphere which are warming the planet at an alarming rate.

    Earth's climate is changing at a pace that threatens human health, society, and the natural environment.
    These changes include warmer air and ocean temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns, retreating snow and ice, increasingly severe weather events, such as hurricanes of greater intensity, and sea level rise, among other impacts.
    Federal agencies are working together to develop a Greenhouse Gas Monitoring and Information System (GHGMIS) for the U.S. to meet climate mitigation goals.
    This system uses these advanced capabilities, as well as the growth of GHG observational data and models, to provide enhanced emissions and uptake data products that can be used by decision-makers.
