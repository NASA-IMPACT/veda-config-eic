description: "
  Central to the exhibit is a 22-foot LED hyperwall framed by two circular 4K screens.
  The 21-minute loop features three videos, dashboards with real-time data on climate and Earth science, along with dazzling imagery of our planet.
  NASA collects information about Earth on a variety of scales ranging from ground-based data to space-based observations from NASAâ€™s fleet of Earth-observing satellites.
  Collecting information at each scale is important and, when combined, provides a comprehensive understanding of how the components of the atmosphere, land, and ocean influence each other.
  With this understanding the datasets become more powerful tools for addressing environmental challenges and climate change.
