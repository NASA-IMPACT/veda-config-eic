    <Caption>
      NASA satellites provide data on Earth's land, ecosystems, water, air, temperature, and climate-- and have done so for more than 50 years. 
      Earth information from space supports decision makers, partners, and people in developing the tools needed to mitigate, adapt, and respond to our changing planet. 
      At the Earth Information Center, visitors can see how our planet is changing in areas that affect lives and livelihoods-- from temperatures in our cities to sea level rise, greenhouse gas emissions to agricultural productivity. 
      The center showcases large, awe-inspiring visualizations, as well as interactive media, stories and narratives, to show how viewing Earth from space can improve lives in the face of disasters, environmental challenges, and climate change.
