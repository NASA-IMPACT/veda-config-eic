        "caption":"Weather models begin their forecasts by integrating observations from ground stations, aircraft, balloons, and a growing constellation of Earth observing satellites to estimate the most realistic atmospheric state. The Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing (GEOS-FP) system is a research model maintained by NASA\u2019s Global Modeling and Assimilation Office to demonstrate innovative new ways to use satellite data to improve predictions of weather, air quality, and greenhouse gases and to help NASA collect new observations of our home planet. \n\r\nNear surface wind speed is calculated by sampling model fields at 10 meters (about 30 feet) above Earth\u2019s surface. Wind speed is typically largest over ocean because surfaces are smooth and result in less friction than over land. Organized patterns reflect weather fronts and storm systems around the world. Near surface winds help scientists track the movement and severity of storms and air pollution episodes. Increasingly, these kinds of products help wind energy managers plan resources to help meet the world\u2019s demand for energy while reducing the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change.\nVisualizations by: Joseph V.

        "caption":"Discover the pivotal role of NASA's Black Marble in bridging scientific discovery and actionable environmental stewardship. By capturing Earth's night lights, Black Marble reveals both the planet's beauty and the profound impact of human activities. This webpage showcases newly developed nighttime light maps comparing changes observed from 2012 to 2023, offering a decade-long perspective on urban growth, infrastructure development, and the socioeconomic dynamics of communities worldwide. This data empowers users to foster informed, sustainable practices that enhance community resilience and mitigate the adverse effects of climate change. By illuminating the intricate interplay between human activity and the environment, Black Marble underpins a human-centered approach to environmental change, promoting a future where scientific innovation leads to tangible, positive impacts on global sustainability.\n\nThis version is specifically formatted for the NASA Earth Information Center (EIC), which has a wider-than-standard video aspect ratio.
