    ## Info

    Hurricanes, tropical cyclones, blizzards, landslides, floods and droughts -- when they arrive in communities they can cause a disaster.
    As climate change is spurring more frequent and extreme weather events, disasters are becoming more costly and damaging.

    Earth data and rapid information sharing between agencies is more important than ever.
    Before, during and after disasters strike, federal agencies coordinate with state, local, tribal and territorial decision-makers, providing actionable data to respond and recover from the effects of disasters and build resilient communities.

  ## Disasters
  Hurricanes, tropical cyclones, blizzards, landslides, floods and droughts -- when they arrive in communities they can turn into a disaster. As climate change is spurring more extreme weather events, disasters are becoming more costly and damaging. Earth data and rapid information sharing between agencies are more important than ever.
  Before, during and after disasters strike, Federal agencies coordinate with decision-makers and local governments, providing actionable data to recover from disaster impacts and build resilient communities.
