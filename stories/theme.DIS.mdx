  ## Disasters
  Hurricanes, tropical cyclones, blizzards, landslides, floods, and droughts – when they arrive in communities they can turn into a disaster. As climate change is spurring more extreme weather events, disasters are becoming more costly and damaging. Earth-observations and rapid information sharing between agencies is more important than ever. Before, during, and after disasters strike, NASA coordinates with decision-makers and local governments, providing actionable data to recover from disaster impacts and build resilient communities.

    The daily Arctic sea ice and land cover changes from the yearly maximum reach of the ice on Feb. 25, 2022, to its minimum on Sep. 18, 2022. The yellow boundary shows the minimum reach of the ice across the sea averaged over the 30-year period from 1981 to 2010. Arctic sea ice minimum has been decreasing at a rate of 13% per decade.

    This data spiral shows the reach of Arctic sea ice from October 1978 to September 2022. This view highlights the loss of Arctic sea ice over the years. To the right are the winter months when the sea ice maximum extent begins outside the yellow line marking 15 million km2 (around 6 million mi2). It then slowly shifts inward, indicating a smaller area of winter sea ice in recent years. On the left, the Arctic sea ice minimum in September shows drastic decreases in size from year to year, at a rate of about 13% per decade.

    This rainbow of colors show the water temperature on the oceans’ surface. The temperature variations correspond to the flow of currents on the surface. Blue is 32 degrees Fahrenheit, green is 50 -70 F, yellow is about 80 F, red is 90 F. This visualization came from computer models by a joint MIT/NASA-JPL project "Estimating the Circulation and Climate of the Ocean, Phase II.”
