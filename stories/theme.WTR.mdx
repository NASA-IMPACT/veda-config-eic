    ## Info

    Water is a vital resource to life on Earth.
    While the majority of Earth's surface is covered in water, only 1% of Earth's water is readily available for use.
    This includes water used in essential activities such as consumption or agricultural practices required to sustain life.
    As populations expand and demand for water grows, understanding how changing temperatures and precipitation patterns impact global water supply is important.
    The water cycle describes how water moves throughout the planet's atmosphere, oceans and land; highlighting connections among each phase of the cycle.
    Using a combination of Earth observing satellites and sensors, ground-based monitoring and scientific modeling, we can observe Earth's water resources at all stages of the water cycle.
    This information can be used to make informed management decision surrounding the most vital resource on planet Earth.

      NASA is helping communities safeguard one of their most essential resources: clean water. When wildfires burn, 	soot and other contaminants often pollute streams, lakes, and rivers and overwhelm downstream treatment plants. Communities like the city of Eugene, Oregon now use critical NASA satellite data to map vulnerable areas for faster response.
      Combining satellite observations with local expertise, these NASA-supported tools empower natural resource managers and utilities to better protect drinking water, allocate resources, and reduce damage to infrastructure.
