    Pieces of ice float in the water, mirroring the glacier's edge.
    Rocky, brown mountain peaks rise behind the ice, contrasting the icy blue with earthy tones under a cloudy sky.

    ## Info

    The effects of sea level rise have been observed across the world.
    Hazards such as coastal flooding can pose health and safety risks for seaside residents and displace vulnerable communities.

    At the local scale, scientists study a variety of factors that contribute to regional sea level rise including periodic change in sea level due to storm surges, ice melt, the amount of water stored on land (including rivers, lakes and aquifers), land subsistence and changes in water temperature and salinity.
    At the global scale, loss of ice through melting glaciers and icesheets, thermal expansion from heat trapped in oceans and changes in the amount of water stored on land all influence the amount of change in sea level observed.
    Understanding how these factors change on a global scale also allows us to better understand changes in Earth's atmosphere and oceans.

    Using a combination space-based observations, ground-based monitoring and modeling, federal agencies work with local organizations across the country and internationally to prepare for and mitigate the impacts of sea level rise.

            alt="This image shows a stylized map projection of the Earth's oceans with a time-series plot overlaid on it. The y-axis of the plot is labeled 'Ocean Heat Increase since 1957 (zettajoules),' and the x-axis represents years from 1960 to 2020. The orange line graph indicates the trend of increasing ocean heat content over this period, with a notable rise from the 1980s onward. The map highlights major oceans, including the Arctic Ocean, North Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Southern Ocean, and the North and South Pacific Oceans, set against a dark background for visual contrast."

          The cumulative increase in ocean heat content from 1957 to 2020, measured in zettajoules. The orange line represents the trend in ocean heat content, showing a significant and consistent rise, particularly from the 1980s onward. The background map highlights the global distribution of the oceans, emphasizing the widespread impact of increasing heat content across different ocean basins.
