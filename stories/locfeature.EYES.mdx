  This interactive tool allows users to fly along with NASA's Earth observing missions in real-time, view satellite imagery of recent weather events, and monitor some of Earth's vital signs, including temperature, carbon dioxide, atmospheric ozone, and sea level. The kiosk has a touch screen for users to scroll to their location of interest, select a satellite to learn more about a mission, and interact with the 3D globe.
