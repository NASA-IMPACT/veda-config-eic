        "caption":"This visualization shows concentrations of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the lower atmosphere as detected by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's Aura satellite, averaged yearly from 2005-2022. Over time, this air pollutant decreased even though population and the number of cars on the roads increased. The shift is the result of regulations, technology improvements, and economic changes. This air pollutant affects respiratory system and is an ingredient in other air pollutants like ground-level ozone. Nitrogen dioxide is mainly created by the burning of gasoline in cars and coal in power plants."

The highest concentrations appear as white and lower levels showing in grades of purple  Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to about one-third of global warming. Wetland habitats include waterlogged soils and permafrost, making them important reservoirs for carbon and thus help guard against global warming. But as a warming climate floods or dries out wetlands, their trapped carbon gets released into the atmosphere as methane."

Combining active fire detections via NASA's Suomi-NPP satellite with computer models, Earth scientists could update the size of the fire and estimate where it would spread. The data from Suomi-NPP provided updated data every 12 hours. In this visualization, yellow lines show the fire front lines based on the active fire data (red points) every 12 hours. In total, the Dixie fire burned for more than 100 days, including more than a month of fire activity after the perimeter was contained in mid-September."
