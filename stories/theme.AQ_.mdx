  ## Air Quality
  Air pollution is a global hazard, so it takes a combination of airborne, ground, and satellite-based tools to better understand the origins and movement of pollutants, as well as the impacts on air quality. 

  The causes of air pollution vary from human activities, such as coal-fired power plants, to natural events, like wildfires and dust storms.


  Ground-based measurements are also used to assess air quality and the concentrations of different types of atmospheric pollution. Satellite data helps fill the gaps between ground-based monitors, so there is global coverage over all neighborhoods.

  Satellite-acquired data have many health and air-quality applications, including:
  * Monitoring the movement of wildfire smoke and dust plumes
  * Tracking the path of ash from volcanic eruptions
  * Identifying concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and other pollutants near cities, suburbs, and major transportation systems.
  * Understanding how concentrations of these pollutants are changing over time.

      ### DID YOU KNOW?
      The ozone hole is primarily caused by human-produced chemicals like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), which were banned by an international treaty in 1989 to protect our natural sunscreen. Modern global warming is driven by greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide (CO2) and is primarily linked to the burning of fossil fuels.

  This visualization shows concentrations of the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide in the lower atmosphere as detected by the Ozone Monitoring Instrument on NASA's Aura satellite, averaged yearly from 2005-2022. Over time, this air pollutant decreased even though population and the number of cars on the roads increased. The shift is the result of regulations, technology improvements, and economic changes.
  This air pollutant affects respiratory system and is an ingredient in other air pollutants like ground-level ozone. Nitrogen dioxide is mainly created by the burning of gasoline in cars and coal in power plants.

    Nitrogen dioxide can impact the respiratory system, and it is an ingredient in pollutants including ground-level ozone. The gas is produced primarily during the burning of gasoline in cars and trucks and coal in power plants.

    This view of methane emissions from wetlands runs from 1980-2021. The highest concentrations appear as white and lower levels showing in grades of purple  Methane is a greenhouse gas that contributes to about one-third of global warming. Wetland habitats include waterlogged soils and permafrost, making them important reservoirs for carbon and thus help guard against global warming. But as a warming climate floods or dries out wetlands, their trapped carbon gets released into the atmosphere as methane.

      The largest fire in California’s recorded history was the 2021 Dixie Fire. Combining active fire detections via NASA’s Suomi-NPP satellite with computer models, Earth scientists could update the size of the fire and estimate where it would spread. The data from Suomi-NPP provided updated data every 12 hours. In this visualization, yellow lines show the fire front lines based on the active fire data (red points) every 12 hours. In total, the Dixie fire burned for more than 100 days, including more than a month of fire activity after the perimeter was contained in mid-September.
