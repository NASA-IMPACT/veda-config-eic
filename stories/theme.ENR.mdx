    ## Info

    Whether deciding the optimal location for solar panels or designing sustainable buildings, Federal agencies are using modern techniques to inform daily decisions made by individuals and industry alike.
    Researchers use information from satellites and sensors in combination with ground-based gauges to learn how changes in climate are linked with changes in energy supply and demand across the globe.
    The results from this research can be used by households, towns, cities, and states to make more informed decisions surrounding community planning and energy use.
