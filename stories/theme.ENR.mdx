    Rural landscape featuring modern wind turbines towering over green hills.
    The foreground shows a large wind turbine with its blades in clear focus, while additional turbines line the rolling hills in the background.
    Scattered houses and farmsteads dot the landscape, under a sky with fluffy white clouds.

    ## Info

    Whether deciding the optimal location for solar panels or designing sustainable buildings, federal agencies are using modern techniques to inform daily decisions made by individuals and industry alike.
    Researchers use information from satellites and sensors in combination with ground-based gauges to learn about energy supply and demand across the globe.
    The results from this research can be used by households, towns, cities and states to make more informed decisions surrounding community planning and energy use.

      From the skies above the American West to the vantage point of the International Space Station, NASA scientists are using advanced imaging spectroscopy to uncover what lies hidden in plain sight: critical minerals essential to our daily lives. Lithium, cobalt, neodymium, and dozens of other critical minerals are essential components in our phones, computers, clean energy technologies, and national security technology. By capturing the unique “spectral fingerprints” of these minerals, researchers can map where they are located on Earth, helping ensure resources for the future while deepening our understanding of the planet.
      The Geological Earth Mapping Experiment (GEMx) is a joint effort between NASA and the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) to advance our knowledge of critical mineral resources in the Western United States. In September 2023, NASA aircraft began supporting an effort to find and map critical mineral deposits in Western regions of the U.S. Identifying these minerals  could help improve environmental processes for mining and geological activities, enhance national security, and boost the economy. This project will continue through Fall 2026.
