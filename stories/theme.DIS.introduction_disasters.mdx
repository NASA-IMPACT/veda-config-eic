  ## Disasters
  Hurricanes, tropical cyclones, blizzards, landslides, floods, and droughts -- when they arrive in communities they can turn into a disaster. As climate change is spurring more extreme weather events, disasters are becoming more costly and damaging. Earth data and rapid information sharing between agencies is more important than ever.
  Before, during, and after disasters strike, Federal agencies coordinate with decision-makers and local governments, providing actionable data to recover from disaster impacts and build resilient communities.
