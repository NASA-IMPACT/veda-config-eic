description: "
  The Hyperwall features videos, dashboards with real-time data on climate and Earth science, along with dazzling imagery of our planet.
  The Earth Information Center collects information about Earth on a variety of scales ranging from ground-based data to space-based observations from all our inter-agency partners.
  Collecting information at each scale is important and, when combined, provides a comprehensive understanding of how the components of the atmosphere, land and ocean influence each other.
  With this understanding the datasets become more powerful tools for addressing environmental challenges and climate change.
