    ## Info

    Planetary change includes more than understanding the physical components of our planet, it also includes understanding how diversity of life on Earth is changing too.
    Biodiversity refers to the variety, or diversity, of all life on Earth.
    However, changes in temperature, precipitation, and land cover directly impact the ability of species to survive and the habitats where they are found.
    Researchers in local habitats work on the ground, directly monitoring vegetation and wildlife, while researchers using remote sensing techniques study biodiversity from space-based and airborne missions.
    Both approaches provide critical information on species richness and distribution across the globe.
    Additionally, modeling can be used to forecast how species and their habitat may change in the future.
    This information is also used across multiple scales of research and government to inform management practices.
