description: "
  Space for Earth invites viewers to experience Earth as can only be seen from space â€” as an interconnected world, lacking boundaries or limits.
  This immersive audio-visual installation invites visitors to explore Earth's changing vital signs. Observe, interact with, and become part of the data different federal agencies use to understand our changing planet.
  Narrated by: Astronauts Nicole Stott and Andrew Feustel

    Photograph of the inside of the Space for Earth exhibit-- a cube painted pure black. The image is illuminated only by the projected green leaf imagery and image of Earth from space. A woman stands in wonder, observing the scene.
